  <h1>Our Approach</h1>
<p>At PadSquad, we believe in engagement—audience engagement and brand engagement. We’ve built world-class technology combined with old-fashioned media experience to make engagement work for publishers and advertisers.

Our proprietary Tablet Engagement Platform offers web publishers a free solution to reformat and restyle their content into clean, easy to navigate tablet and mobile optimized experiences. Our technology is a cutting-edge responsive design platform focusing on a single URL and One Web approach. PadSquad publishers use their existing URL, no messy T.dot or M.dot redirects, leveraging all the benefits of SEO, deep links, and social sharing for audience growth. Our publishers see significant growth in impressions and revenue by working with us.

We work with leading national brand advertisers to create scalable solutions for optimal engagement. PadSquad believes in creating custom solutions that are specifically tailored for tablets and smart phone audiences on our platform. The fact is, tablet users are different from smart phone audiences, and PadSquad are the experts in brand integration across both in the right way at the right time. Our advertising partners see amazing results in response, brand lift, time spent, and post-click actions.</p>
